# About me and this site

Hi, my name is Aditia. Welcome to my personal blog :wave:.

I'm building in public. What am I building? Stay tuned and I'll post about my journey here.

## My tech stack

### Hardware

* [MacBook Air 2017](https://amzn.to/3qgFexI){:target="_blank"}

   My trusty old MacBook Air. It's awesome that Apple still supports it with the latest macOS--at least until the time I'm writing this. I need a bigger storage, though. 128 GB of SSD feels crampy everytime there's an OS update. I have to unsync my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/AACiql6PO5x2Nf3wdZjEfX3s_dzel_QMX6E?src=global9){:target="_blank"} folder to make room for the update.

* [iPad Pro 2018](https://amzn.to/3zNDalt){:target="_blank"}

   Bought it new from eBay auction for less than ~$500 of its price back in 2019. I use it mainly for reading. I learned to draw on [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ipad){:target="_blank"} with my [Apple Pencil](https://amzn.to/3APZFXm){:target="_blank"} but it seems that digital drawing is not my cup of tea. Covered it with [Otterbox Symmetry Case](https://amzn.to/3i1bbGV){:target="_blank"} to protect it from scratches or dents.

* [Logitech K380 Bluetooth Keyboard](https://amzn.to/3xDibzO){:target="_blank"}

  A great and affordable keyboard. I use it if I want to type on iPad.

## About this site

I built this using Jekyll and it's hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}. I'm using Minimal Mistakes for the theme, made by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com "Check his awesome blog"){:target="_blank"}.

### A little bit of disclosure about affiliate programs

Some of the links in this blog are affiliate links, which means that if you go through them to make a purchase I will earn some lunch money :pizza:. This won't cost you anything but it helps me to offset the costs of maintaining this blog.

I don't and won't let the compensation I receive influence my opinions and advice in my blog.
